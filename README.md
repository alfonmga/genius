## About

I've made sure to include all sorts of feedbacks and visual aides. Some people work better with colors, others with numbers, others with directions (left, right, up, down), others even with letters (w, a, s, d - I'm looking at you PC players). The game accommodate all this controls (arrows, letters, numbers, clicks and touches). I hope you find this project fun.
